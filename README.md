# dynet-c: Plain-c bindings for DyNet

> **Attention:**
> * Contribution are welcomed!
> * This is a **temporary** placement for dynet c-api, a pull request will be made to the main repository when basic functions are fully implemented!(Of course, after some discusssion and modification)
> * Directly using C api to write dynet program is not so convenient, but you still can if you are fond of C.☺️ Check the example.The main usage of this project is for creating bindings for other languages, such as Rust, Swift or Go.

## Building from source
1. Make sure **clang** is already installed.
2. Build **DyNet** library first. Please follow the instruction in section "C++ installation" on [DyNet project page](https://github.com/clab/dynet).
3. Download this project:
```bash
cd  /path/to/dynet/contrib
git clone git@github.com:xbainbain/dynet-c.git
cd dynet-c
```  
4. Build dynet for c and examples with following instruction:
```bash
cmake ./
make
```
5. (Optional) Run the example:
```bash
./test
```

## Implementation details
The choice of the exposed API is based on the [Python API](http://dynet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_ref.html) for dynet and the end-user usage situation of dynet.

The name convention follows [tensorflow c-api project](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/c).

## To do
- [x] Basic functions' implementation.
- [ ] Error handling


## Contribution
Any suggestion and discussion about the choices of API or implementation details are welcomed!
